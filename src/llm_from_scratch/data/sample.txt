"This is a sample text file for demonstrating the LLM from scratch project.

It contains some example text that can be used for training language models.

The goal is to build a large language model from scratch using Python and PyTorch.

This repository will contain implementations of various components like:
- Tokenization
- Model architecture (transformers)
- Training loops
- Evaluation methods

We'll start with simple implementations and gradually build up to more complex architectures."
